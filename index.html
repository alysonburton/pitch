					<blockquote> &ldquo;Even more telling, a growing roster of food-tech startups, some  backed by serious venture money and socially minded billionaires such as  Bill Gates, are innovating plant-based products to replace meat, eggs and dairy. They’re addressing  growing concerns about the planet’s continued ability to feed an exploding world population with animal products as water resources and available land grow scarcer and climate change escalates. They’re also showing concern for animal welfare, and yes, these entrepreneurs and their investors are hoping to make some money in the process&rdquo; –Sebastiano Castiglioni, &ldquo;Vegan Investor&rdquo;, Forbes </blockquote>

				<section><h1>Problem</h1>
					<p>Everyday new vegan businesses are popping up here in LA and all over the world, businesses that often either through lack of funds or lack of knowledge end up with very poor branding and websites. </p>
					<aside class="notes">
						These businesses are often started by people who are foreign to our market, and usually know nothing about branding, typography or websites and end up muddling through it themselves, and thus missing out on the amount of business that a good branding and marketing strategy can bring in. And because of this, a lot of them fail, because no one even knew they existed. 
						<br>

						What if there was a vegan design firm that came to them and worked to help them succeed? The trust would already be there, we'd all be working towards the same goal and with our help they'd reach a bigger audience, set up a professional brand and a website that attracted customers.

					<aside class="notes"> we currently have a team of 3 people:
					John has been working with local businesses for 3 years through a finacial firm and is excellent at networking, in fact he found me a vegan business consultant who is offereing her services to us for free. He will be our marketing strategist both helping us succeed as well as the businesses we work with. 
					<br>

					I've been doing freelance work for vegan businesses for a little over 2 years, I've been art directing at the sundial for about a year and I've worked in front-end development as well
					<br>

					David has been working in back-end development for 6 years now and is extrememly knowledgable.
					<br>
					
					Whats great about our team is that we're all good friends. I can't tell you how many times David has helped me with web projects and John helped me gather information for this presentation. We are confident in each other's skills and in the success of our business

				<section><h1>Business Model con't</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Start local</li>
					<li>Approach new and current vegan businesses offering our services</li>
					<li>Slowly build up to a point in which we can rent a physical local and start hiring more staff</li>
					<li>Get to the point where the design firm is running sucessfully on its own, then branch out to Portland and finally a remote firm employing vegans all over the world</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
				We plan to file for an LLC in December and launch in January
				<br>

				It should take about a year to get enough steady business to afford physical location. 
				We'll spend the next year increasing staff and business, and we estimate that in 3-4 years the firm should be self-sufficient, meaning I'll have found a business manager I can trust to run the LA firm in which time I will be moving to Portland to open a second location. 
				<br>

				Finally once that's steady, we will open up employment worldwide and set up a base of vegan designers, developers and marketing experts to work with vegan businesses not located in LA or Portland.

				<section><h1>Underlying Magic</h1>
				<blockquote>
					"People do not buy goods and services. They buy relations, stories and magic" 
					– Seth Godin, Entrepreneur 
				</blockquote>
				<h5>Our business will be successful because:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>It's not just a business</li>
					<li>No competition</li>
					<li>Community Days: we will spend 1-2 paid days a month giving back to the community </li>
					<li>Philanthropy: A portion of all proceeds will benefit animal welfare organizations</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
				Our underlying magic. in the words of Seth Godin, author, entrepreneur, marketer, and public speaker
				Firm Tofu not just a business, its a story, its an understanding of the world around us and how our choices effect it and people are very passionate about that. I've seen it countless times, vegans love to spread the word about new vegan businesses, in fact we just had a vegan street fair in north hollywood, first one of its kind and had a turn out of over 2 thousand people. They had to turn people away 2 hours before closing bc all the food sold out. THAT'S DEMAND. 
				<br>
				on top of it we're gonna give back to the community with community days (idea inspired by thoughtbot) where we go out into the community, do beach clean ups, volunteer at shelters, whatever's needed and we'll give monthly donations to local and global animal welfare organizations. now how could a vegan business say no to that?
				</aside>

				<section><h1>Financial Projections &amp; Key metrics</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Start by splitting profit 3 ways</li>
					<li>As business grows, hire a Finance Manager</li>
					<li>Competitive Salary for employees with benefits</li>
					<li>Pricing: Start case by case, then develop packages based on the demand we see</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
				I don't imagine there being much of a cost at the beginning, aside from the LLC paperwork.
				<br>
				Once we start getting enough work to increase our staff and obtain a location, we will hire a finance manager to handle payment of employees, and business costs bc that is not our expertise 
				<br>
				We will pay our employees well and provide benefits such as health insurance, which will actually be cheaper since everyone will be vegan
				we'll also work with our clientel to get our employees additional benefits at their facilites, like meal discounts which will bring in more business to our clients as well as providing some exclusive benefits to working at our design firm
				<br>
				for pricing we'll start out on a case by case basis and as we continue to grow our clientel we'll develop packages based on their most common needs
